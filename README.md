# React Course Manager

This project (yet abandonned) was a good way to improve my React skills on a personal project. I wanted to help the students of my promotion to manage in a more efficient way their agendas.

On top of that I wanted to allow easier management for the managers of the Master, who had to go through a lot of headaches to manage to make agendas fit to teachers expectations. I wanted to implement optimization algorithm, but I ran out of time and motivation.
